1.What is Computer?
  Answer: A computer is an electronic device designed to process, managae and analzye data. Performing a range of tasks, from simple calculations to complex operations, based on the user instruction.
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
2.What are the essential parts of computer?
  Answer: The essential parts of computer consist of: 
      -CPU or Central Processing Unit that interprets and executes intrusction from programs.
      -RAM or Random Access Memory where the computer temporarily stores data that is used or processed.
      -Storage such as:
          -HHDs or Hard drivers.
          -SSDs or Solid-state drives.
            That acts as a storage.
      -Motherboard that act as a hourses to CPU, RAM, and other crucial componentrs.  
      -PSU or Power Supply Unit that supply electrical power to the computer's components.
      -Input Devices such as:
          -Mouse (let's users interact with the graphical interface) and Keyboards (Allowing urses to input text and commands)
      -Output Devices such as:
          -Printer (Produces physical copies of digital documents), Speakers (Produces sounds), and Monitors(Displays visual output from the computer).
      -GPU or Graphics Processing Unit
      -Cooling System such as heat sink to remove heat from CPUE, GPU and other components.
      -NIC or Network Interface Card that allows the computer cto connect to networks such as internet or localk area network (LAN).

3.Who are the notable inventors of hardware and software? Cite atleast (5) software developers and (5) hardware developers.
  Answer:The (5) Software developers and (5)Hardware developers are.
    Software developers
        1.Bill Gates- 
                  CO-founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates played a crucial role in the development and popularization of personal computing with Microsoft's Windows OPeration Systerm and office software (Wikipedia contributors, 2024).
        2.Grace Hopper- 
                  One of the main developer of Mark I computer in 1944, Her team able to create the earliers COBOL compiler in 1952, 
                  With the creatiopn of COBOl it became possible for the first time in the world to create a software without having to basically tell it one instruction at the time (Quiles, 2019).
        3.Gary Kildall-
                  Main developer of the first BIOS for microcomputers, Turning into a first real microcomputer operationg system that runs based on operating system of Intel-Based 8-bit Microcomputers (Quiles, 2019).
        4.Dennis Ritchie-
                  One of the main developer of C languange, It used to create many types of applications and operationg system such as Windows, and other complicated programs (Ravikiran, 2024).
        5.Bjarner Stroustrup-
                  Developer of C++ programming language, Becoming one of the most influential programming languages in the history of computing (Georgiev, 2020).
    Hardware developers
        1.John Hennessy-
                  Inventory of reduced instruction set computer (RISC) chips, increasing perfomances of a computer while reducing ccost that revolutionized the computer industry (Little, 2018)
        2.James B. Keller-
                  Lead architect of the AMD K8 Microarchitecture including the original Athlon 64m providing around 90% of the gaming performances of a single core, while being cheaper and offering all of the benefits of a dual core CPU (Wikipedia contributors, 2024b).
        3.Gordon E. Moore-
                  Creator of Moore's law, Co-founder of Intel Corporation, know for More's Law that predicts the doubling of transistor on a microchip approximately evrey two years, making power twice and cost cut in haflf in every two years (Science History Institute, 2024).
        4.Andy Grove-
                  Inventor of Intel Pentium Processor, A very crucial piece that impacted the development of microprocessors that power modern computing (The City College of New York, 2021).
        5.Steve Jobs-
                  The creator of Macintosh, Typography on screen, Mouse, iMac(1998), iPod(2001), iPad (2010) and the iconic iPhone (Conocimiento, 2018).
